      <h2>About the Owners</h2>
      <img src="images/sarah-and-andy.jpg" alt="Sarah and Andy - The Owners">
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We brought the house at the end of 2012. After spending vacations in Ventura
          we fell in love with the area. The beach lifestyle, surfing, kite boarding
          and diving are what make Ventura an amazing place to live and visit!
          The relaxing and friendly vibe of the Pierpont neighborhood is what sets it
          apart from all others.
        </p>
